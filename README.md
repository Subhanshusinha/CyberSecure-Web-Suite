🛡️ Sentinel Dashboard: Your Unified Cyber Hub

🌟 Project Overview

Sentinel Dashboard is a comprehensive, single-page application designed to empower users with essential real-time cybersecurity tools and information. By integrating Phishing Detection, a robust Password Strength Checker, and up-to-the-minute Cybersecurity News, this dashboard serves as your first line of digital defense against common threats.

It is built for simplicity and efficiency, providing critical security awareness in a clean, intuitive interface.

✨ Key Features

🎣 Phishing Detection Analyzer

A powerful tool to help verify the legitimacy of URLs before clicking.

✅ URL Input: Easily paste suspicious links.

✅ Safety Score: Provides an analysis of the link's potential threat level (e.g., suspicious characters, domain age, known blacklists).

✅ Visual Cues: Clear, color-coded results (Green for safe, Red for dangerous).

🔒 Password Strength Checker

Encourage better security habits by instantly validating password complexity.

✅ Real-time Feedback: Checks strength as the user types.

✅ Criteria Breakdown: Scores based on length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and common patterns.

✅ Entropy Calculation: Offers a metric that reflects how long it would take a hacker to crack the password.

📰 Cybersecurity News Feed

Stay informed with the latest threats, vulnerabilities, and industry developments.

✅ Aggregated Content: Fetches recent articles from top cybersecurity news sources.

✅ Quick Summaries: Presents concise headlines and snippets for fast consumption.

✅ Direct Links: Seamless navigation to the full source articles.

🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and a code editor.

Installation

Clone the Repository:

git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
cd sentinel-dashboard


API Key Setup (If applicable):
If you use an external service for News or Phishing detection, you will need to set up an API key.

Create a file named .env in the root directory.

Add your API keys (e.g., for a News API) to this file. Note: For a static HTML/JS project, you might need to handle keys differently, or use a public feed.

Run Locally:
Since this is a single-page application, you can open the main HTML file directly in your browser.

open index.html


Alternatively, use a live-server extension in your code editor (like VS Code's Live Server) for a better development experience.
