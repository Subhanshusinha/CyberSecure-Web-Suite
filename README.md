## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
You need a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and a code editor.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd sentinel-dashboard
    ```
2.  **API Key Setup (If applicable):**
    If you use an external service for News or Phishing detection, you will need to set up an API key.
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root directory.
    * Add your API keys (e.g., for a News API) to this file.

3.  **Run Locally:**
    Since this is a single-page application, you can open the main HTML file directly in your browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```
    Alternatively, use a live-server extension in your code editor (like VS Code's Live Server) for a better development experience.
